# Automation Center

**Tier:** Pro | **Type:** Internal / Admin

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    Automation Center is the system-wide operations cockpit. It centralizes health indicators, quality visibility, and cross-site job review so operators can manage capacity and failures without diving into individual sites. Admin gating is what keeps powerful controls safe.

## Overview

Key sections include: Automation System Status badges, operational health tiles (job-type metrics), Automation Insights KPIs, Recent Jobs, Dead Letter Queue, site links, and system statistics.

Quick Actions:
- “View X Scheduled Posts” scrolls to the Recent Jobs panel.
- Admin-only queue management controls (Pause, Resume, Retry All, Clear Pending) have working backend endpoints.

Access control note: DLQ, queue controls, and runtime flags are admin-only.

## Why It Matters

Gives operators one place to understand the automation system’s overall health and intervene when failures or capacity issues affect multiple sites.
