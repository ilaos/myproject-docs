!!! tip "Key Insight"
    This is why "Long" actually means 1,500–2,000 words of substance, not fluff. Addresses the common AI content complaint of "looks long but says nothing." Marketable as "depth by design, not word count padding.”

## Overview

Replaces vague word-count targets with architectural requirements. Long-form content mandates H3 sub-sections to ensure every paragraph has technical purpose — no "thin" content allowed. Integrates LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords and industry-specific context (regulations, material specs, climate factors) to signal topical dominance to search engines.
