# Automation Settings

**Tier:** Pro | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    The UI keeps the most dangerous control (auto-publish) explicit and discouraged, while still supporting hands-off publishing for teams that want it.

## Overview

Key settings include:
- Start Date ("Pick when you want automation to begin")
- Schedule duration (in weeks)
- Posting frequency (set via templates/presets and editable in UI)
- Daily cap (editable in UI)
- Publish mode: Draft (default) vs Auto-publish ("Not recommended")
- Preferred Publish Time (shown only when Auto-publish is enabled)
- Email notifications: "Email me when posts are ready to review" + "Notification Email" + "Send Test Email"

## Why It Matters

Gives site owners precise control over the automation’s behavior so they can keep a consistent cadence while matching brand voice, reducing risk, and keeping review steps (draft mode) where needed.

## Requirements

- **Integrations:** OpenAI API, Wordpress API
- **Compatibility:** Wordpress
