# Activity & Logs

**Tier:** Pro/Agency | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    Activity & Logs is the platform’s proof-of-work layer. A single logging utility (log_activity) feeds a filterable timeline (category, severity, date range), with maintenance cleanup and backfill. It also becomes the foundation for client-facing reporting (Work Report Builder) without duplicating “what happened” logic.

## Overview

Unified, per-site timeline inside Client Profile (last tab) that shows everything that happened for a site across content work, SEO analyses, site configuration changes, automation events, and system actions. Replaces the old fragmented approach where users had to check multiple places to understand recent work.

## Why It Matters

Provides a single source of truth for what happened on a site, so users can quickly understand progress, diagnose issues, and report value to clients without hunting across tools.

## Access Control

**Permission Mode:** Configurable per client
