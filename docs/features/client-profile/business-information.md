    This is where E-E-A-T magic begins — and users don't even realize it. The "About Us" field is parsed at content-generation time to extract tenure years ("since 2005" → 20 years). The "Industry Type" auto-maps to authority titles (legal → Attorney, plumbing → Technician, mold remediation → Specialist). Users fill in normal business info; AlmaSEO turns it into authority signals automatically. This invisible intelligence is worth calling out in marketing: "Your business profile becomes your content's credibility.”
