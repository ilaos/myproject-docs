!!! tip "Key Insight"
    Multi-location support is HUGE for agencies managing franchises, multi-branch businesses, or service area businesses. Each location gets its own NAP monitoring. The Service Area Business toggle shows sophistication — AlmaSEO understands that plumbers and mobile services don't have storefronts. Acceptable Addresses prevents false positives in NAP audits. Marketable as: "Manage all your locations — and monitor NAP consistency for each one." Strong selling point for local SEO agencies.

## Overview

Manages multiple business locations with individual NAP (Name, Address, Phone) data. Each location includes: Basic Info (location name, code, business name if different, phone, email, hours), Address (with Service Area Business toggle for mobile/home-based businesses that hides street address), and Acceptable Addresses (alternate address variations that NAP Shield should not flag as inconsistencies). One location is marked Primary — used as default for content generation and synced to main site record. Supports bulk import/export via CSV for franchises. Legacy data from old Business Information tab shows as convertible card. Location data feeds into content generation via prompt variables ({City}, {Service_Areas}) and NAP Shield monitoring.
