# Client Profile

**Tier:** Agency | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    This is where "we know your business" becomes real. The depth of Client Profile is what separates AlmaSEO from tools that just generate generic content. Every field here makes the output smarter. For agencies, this is also the multi-client management story — one dashboard, all your clients, each with their own profile.

## Overview

The command center for each site/client. Every site added to AlmaSEO gets its own Client Profile containing business information, integrations, SEO tools, analytics, and content management. This is where the "intelligence" about a client lives — the data that feeds into content generation, E-E-A-T signals, and personalized recommendations. Agencies managing multiple clients see each as a card on the main dashboard.
