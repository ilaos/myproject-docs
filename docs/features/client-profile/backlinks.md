# Backlinks

**Tier:** Pro | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    Backlinks are usually fragmented across tools. By combining import + verification history + outreach automation in one place, this becomes a retention-grade agency system: it captures institutional knowledge and ties link monitoring directly to action and client reporting.

## Overview

Sub-tabs included:
- Backlinks Overview: import + verification hub with dashboard metrics, CSV importer, bulk verification queue, and status table.
- Opportunities: outreach pipeline of prospects, including auto-created opportunities when a backlink is lost.
- Outreach: email campaign manager with templates, sequences, and engagement tracking via SendGrid webhooks.
- Live links: filtered view of verified live backlinks for ongoing monitoring and reporting.

## Why It Matters

Turns backlinks into a managed workflow: maintain an accurate inventory, detect losses early, and convert link gaps into tracked outreach actions.
