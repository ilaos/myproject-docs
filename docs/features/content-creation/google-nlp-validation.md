    THE differentiator. This isn't AlmaSEO saying "trust us" — it's Google's own AI validating your content quality. Directly preempts "AI slop" criticism. No competitor does this. Marketable as: "Don't take our word for it — see what Google thinks." Screenshot-worthy for marketing. Should be front and center on website.
