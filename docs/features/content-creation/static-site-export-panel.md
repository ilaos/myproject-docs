# Static Site Export Panel

**Tier:** Core/Free | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    THIS is the static site / website builder differentiator in action. The UI makes it dead simple — pick your format, download or copy, grab the image, done. Screenshot-worthy for marketing to Hugo/Astro/Next.js crowd. Also the bridge for Squarespace/Wix users via Quick Copy. Should be prominently featured when targeting non-WordPress audiences.

## Overview

The export interface shown to static site users after content is generated. Displays all Multi-Format Export options (Markdown, HTML Full Page, HTML Body, JSON, MDX, Structured JSON, Structured YAML) with Download and Copy to Clipboard buttons. Includes Featured Image download with placeholder replacement instructions (<!-- ALMASEO_IMAGE: ... -->), Quick Copy buttons (HTML Content, Markdown, SEO Metadata, URL Slug), and expandable SEO Metadata Preview. Replaces WordPress-specific features (IndexNow, Search Console Indexing) which require a live published URL.
