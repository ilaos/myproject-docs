    Same story as Mailchimp Article Blast — extends AlmaSEO into distribution. "Create, publish, AND share — one dashboard." Combined with Mailchimp Article Blast, positions AlmaSEO as true end-to-end content marketing platform, not just content creation. Rather than fighting constantly-changing social media APIs, we generate ready-to-post content the user copies and pastes — giving them full control while saving writing time.

## Overview

Generate AI-optimized, platform-specific social media posts for any published article, directly from the Post Details page. Each platform gets tailored content that respects its character limits and audience expectations. The user copies the text, clicks to open their social media page, and pastes — 30 seconds per platform.

## Why It Matters

Social media distribution is critical for content reach, but direct API posting is impractical: platforms require expensive developer accounts (Twitter/X charges $200+/month), demand app review processes, frequently change their API terms, and require constant OAuth token maintenance. The Social Content Kit approach gives users the speed benefit of AI-generated content without the fragility of API integrations.

## How It Works

1. **Navigate** to any published article's Post Details page
2. **Click** "Generate Social Posts" on the Social Content Kit card (appears below the article alongside Mailchimp Article Blast)
3. **AI generates** platform-optimized content for every platform where the site has a social URL configured
4. **Review & edit** the generated text in editable textareas — live character counters show usage vs. limit
5. **Copy** the text with one click (clipboard copy with "Copied!" confirmation)
6. **Open** the social media page directly via the "Open [Platform]" button (opens in new tab)
7. **Paste & post** on the social platform
8. **Download** the featured image (fetched from WordPress) to attach to the social post

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Character Limit | Content Style |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Facebook** | 63,206 | Conversational, 2-3 short paragraphs, emojis welcome, includes article link |
| **Twitter / X** | 280 | Punchy hook + key insight, 1-2 hashtags, article link included |
| **LinkedIn** | 3,000 | Professional, insight-driven, 2-3 paragraphs with line breaks, article link |
| **Instagram** | 2,200 | Caption style, engaging hook, value-packed body, call to action, 5-10 hashtags |

Only platforms with a URL configured in **Client Profile → Social Profiles** appear in the modal. If no social URLs are set, the card shows a link to configure them.

## Featured Image

The modal includes a featured image section with thumbnail preview and download button. The image is resolved in this order:

1. Local image (if generated by AlmaSEO)
2. Original image URL (if stored)
3. WordPress featured image (fetched via WP REST API using site credentials)

## AI Content Generation

- **Model:** GPT-4o-mini (fast, cost-effective for short creative tasks)
- **Single API call** generates content for all active platforms at once
- **Brand voice:** Uses the site's configured brand voice when available
- **Article context:** Sends article topic + truncated content to inform the generation
- **Fallback:** If OpenAI is unavailable, returns the article topic as-is for each platform

## Info Banner
