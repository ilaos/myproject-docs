# Include Image at Top of Article

**Tier:** Core/Free | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    Small but solves a real annoyance. Some themes don't display featured images automatically, or users want the image IN the content for sharing/export purposes. Shows attention to detail — AlmaSEO anticipates edge cases.

## Overview

Optional toggle that embeds the featured image directly at the top of the article body content as a <figure><img> block, not just as metadata. Appears when any image option is selected (AI generate, upload, Unsplash). Off by default — image only set as featured image metadata. Hides automatically if "No Image" is selected.

## Why It Matters

Optional toggle to embed featured image directly at top of article body.
