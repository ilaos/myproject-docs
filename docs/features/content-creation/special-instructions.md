# Special Instructions

**Tier:** Core/Free | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    The escape valve for edge cases. Agencies have clients with weird requirements — "always mention our founding year," "never use the word 'cheap,'" "link to our location pages." This handles all of it without custom development. Marketable as: "Your specific instructions, followed every time." Also reinforces that users stay in control — AI is a tool, not a replacement.

## Overview

Optional freeform textarea giving users a direct line to the AI prompt. Instructions are injected with high-priority framing and honored across all article types. Supports specific requests like "mention X and hyperlink to Y" (AI outputs actual HTML links), "avoid this word," or "include this detail." The more specific the instruction (including full URLs), the more reliable the result. Does not affect word count.

## Why It Matters

Direct line to AI prompt for edge cases. Escape valve.
