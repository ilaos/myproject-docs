     THIS IS HUGE for agencies with editorial teams. Positions AlmaSEO as valuable even if you don't trust AI to write final copy. "Let us do the strategy, your writers do the writing." Preempts the objection: "But I have my own writers." Standalone video potential targeting agencies with in-house content teams.

## Overview

Toggle option that outputs a detailed content brief for human writers instead of a full AI-generated article. When enabled, shows additional settings: Target Word Count (500–800 to 2000+), Tone Guide (Professional, Conversational, Authoritative, Friendly, Technical), and optional Editorial Guidelines textarea for custom instructions. Submit button changes to "Generate Content Brief," publication options hide, but image generation and email report remain available. Briefs are stored separately and viewable at a dedicated detail page.
