!!! tip "Key Insight"
    Users expect this control. The real magic is that "Long" doesn't just mean more words — it means more structure. That's the Structural Depth Quotas working behind the scenes.

## Overview

Single-select setting controlling article word count. Options: Short (500–700 words), Medium (800–1,000 words), Long (1,200–1,500 words). Works in tandem with Structural Depth Quotas — longer content triggers H3 sub-section requirements to ensure depth, not fluff.
