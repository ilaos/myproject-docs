# Parent Page & Page Order

**Tier:** Pro | **Type:** User-Facing UI

!!! tip "Key Insight"
    Important for SEO site architecture — proper URL hierarchy signals topic relationships to search engines. Agencies building out service area pages or location silos will use this constantly. Not flashy, but essential for doing local SEO correctly.

## Overview

Controls WordPress page hierarchy for non-blog content. Parent Page dropdown fetches existing WordPress pages, allowing users to nest new content as a subpage (e.g., "Mold Remediation in Woodstock" under "Services" creates http://yoursite.com/services/mold-remediation-in-woodstock). Page Order field sets sort position among siblings — lower numbers appear first. Only appears for WordPress sites and non-blog page types (service, city landing, FAQ, glossary, how-to, about us, pillar, listicle, comparison). Hidden for blog posts and freestyle since blogs use categories instead.
